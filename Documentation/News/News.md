### > (3/8/2025) Candle Lighting Now Available in AlceEngine
We're excited to introduce a new integration of Candle into AlceEngine, bringing advanced 2D lighting capabilities to your SFML projects. This implementation includes support for radial and directional lights, fog-based lighting areas, and custom light meshes with support for rectangular, circular, and polygonal shapes.

Designed to be modular and easy to use within the AlceEngine's component system, this integration enables dynamic lighting effects, real-time intensity control, and debug visualizations to streamline your workflow.
